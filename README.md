<H1>The Monkees</H1>

This is a band website for the Monkees, 
It imagines that they are still active and available for bookings.
I wanted to make the site as simple as possible, whilst also fulfiling all the use cases I could think of for a
band site.

<H2>UX</h2>
<il>
<li>As a user, I want to see a lot of information about the band on the homepage.</li>

<li>As a user, I should be able to book the band easily.</li>

<li>As a user, I want to be able to find out information about each band member and the band as a whole. </li>

<li>As a User, I want to listen to the bands music and watch music videos.</li>
</ul>

<li>The Band Page - Allows users to get information about the band</li>
<li>Gallery - Allows users to view pictures of the band</li>

</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>Html 5
</li>
<li>Css</li>
<li>Bootstrap and Fancybox
<ul><li>These libraries use JQuery and Javascript.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
I have tested this website across different browsers and multiple mobile devices.
I gave the Github pages link to multiple people and had them go through the site to see if the UX and to check if there was any 
errors.
<ol>
<li>Footer:
<ol><li>Go to the Any page</li>
<li>Check in developer tools to see that the footer is sticking to the bottom.</li>
<li>Check to see that the footer content fits in all screen sizes and that media queries work.</li></ol></li>
I had a problem with the footer running up the page on "Booking" and "Gallery" This was fixed with giving the body a 
bottom padding equal to the footer size.


<li>Media Queries:
<ol><li>Go to the Any page</li>
<li>Check in developer tools that all the relevant media queries are activating.</li>
<li>Check that site looks good on all common screen sizes.</li></ol></li>



<li>Booking form:
<ol><li>Go to the "Booking" page</li>
<li>Try to submit an empty form and see that an error message stating that there are required fields.</li>
<li>Try to submit the form with an invalid email address see that an error message appears.</li></ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
Site was created in the cloud9 IDE. Then it was published to github pages.
