This is a band website for the Monkees, 
It imagines that they are still active and available for bookings.

<H2>UX</h2>
<il>
<li>As a user, I wanted the most common reasons for vising the site to be on the home page, 
so the latest release and next events are placed here.</li>

<li>As a user, I wanted to be able to book the band easily online, I achieved this by creating a simple responsive booking form.</li>

<li>As a user, </li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul><li>the bootstrap javascript library was used to make the header responsive</li>
<li>JQuery was used for fancybox in the gallery</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Footer:
<ol><li>Go to the Any page</li>
<li>Check in developer tools to see that the footer is sticking to the bottom.</li>

I had a problem with the footer running up the page on "Booking" and "Gallery" This was fixed with giving the body a 
bottom padding equal to the footer size.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
I pushed it to github constantly to make sure I didn't lose any code.
Towards the end of the project I published to github pages, 
to check to make sure it worked properly - during this process I found out the images didn't work and had to add a 
'./' to the file path make images and videos work.
